# Brain-Tumor-Detection
## Project Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to automatically detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques and image processing to differentiate between healthy and malignant tissues in brain images.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes comprehensive preprocessing steps that involve image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the robustness of the CNN model against overfitting and to handle variance in medical imaging.
- **CNN Architecture**: Custom-designed CNN architecture tailored specifically for the task of medical image analysis, with layers optimized for capturing spatial hierarchies in MRI scans.
- **Model Training**: Detailed steps for training the CNN model, including the selection of hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers suited for binary classification of medical images.
- **Evaluation and Testing**: Implementation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Includes visualizations of model predictions and error analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and model development.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on image data.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and results interpretation.
